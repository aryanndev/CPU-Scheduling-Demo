# Energy Efficient CPU Scheduler - Demo
Modern operating systems must balance performance with power
efficiency, especially in mobile, embedded, and energy-constrained
environments. Traditional CPU scheduling algorithms primarily
optimize for throughput or waiting time, often ignoring energy
consumption.
This project, Energy-Efficient CPU Scheduler, is a Python-based
simulation tool that demonstrates how task scheduling decisions affect
overall energy usage. The system is implemented purely as a
Graphical User Interface (GUI) based simulator, allowing users to
interactively input tasks, select scheduling policies, and visualize
execution and energy consumption in real time.
